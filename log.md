### Day 1: April 7th, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learned plotting graphs, matrix calculations using octave

**Thoughts** : Machine learning is fun so far.

### Day 2: April 8th, 2018, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Solved 3 questions in week 2 assignment. Cost function and Gradient descent

**Thoughts** : Matrices are cool

### Day 3: April 9th, 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**:  Feature normalization and Normal Equation for Linear regression with multiple variables, Second part of the ML assignment.

**Thoughts** : ML is not so easy.

### Day 4: April 10th, 2018, Teusday

**Today's Progress**:  Logistic/Classification regression. Learned, not coded. Set up Angular project, since no coding in ML.

**Thoughts** : Overwhelmed with all the equations in ML.

**Link(s) to work** : coming soon...

### Day 5: April 11th, 2018, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  Assignment in logistic regression and regularised logistic regression.

**Thoughts** : Aaaarrggghh! Too much info in very little time. I'll probably go through notes tomorrow. Things are not sinking in completely.

### Day 6: April 12th, 2018, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  In ML, watched a video on neural network. No coding involved, hence worked a little with angular-cli. Fun fact: serve app on '0.0.0.0' instead of 'localhost', then use your IP address to run it on your phone. We have a mobile app now! 

**Thoughts** : Angular has TypeScript, it's not javascript.

### Day 7: April 13th, 2018, Friday

**Today's Progress**:  Learned training the computer to recognise handwritten numbers using Neural Networks.

**Thoughts** : I love how cool that sounds. Okay, to be honest the assignment was providing all data and making things work.

### Day 8: April 14th, 2018, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  Fell asleep watching #NeuralNetworks lecture, made progress with #Angular 

**Thoughts** : Angular's two way binding is insane!
